<p class="has-background has-drop-cap has-very-light-gray-background-color">Recent research has found ginger to be effective for reducing the nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy, and the pain associated with menstruation. It has also shown ginger to be effective against colon cancer and the devastating effects of liver cancer.<br>If you&#8217;re suffering from nausea and vomiting as a result of pregnancy, you may want to consider a daily dose of ginger. Studies were performed on expectant mothers, where half were given 250 mg capsules of ginger four times a day for four days, and the other half of the women received placebos with the same prescriptive form and direction. The ginger users demonstrated a higher rate of improvement compared to the placebo users (85% versus 56%). The decrease in vomiting times among ginger uses was also significantly greater than among the women who received the placebo (50% versus 9%).</p>



<p>Here are some other benefits of ginger that will benefit others, as well:</p>



<ul><li>Ginger halts menstrual pain as effectively as drugs</li><li>Ginger has a distinguished career as a spice and a healer</li><li>Ginger offers potent cancer protection</li><li>Ginger relieves motion sickness</li><li>Use the freshest ginger you can find</li><li>Ginger makes drab dishes come alive</li></ul>

<p class="has-background has-drop-cap has-very-light-gray-background-color">Congratulations on your pregnancy! Now on to the hard part; naming your baby!&nbsp; Baby names are very unique-just like you and your new bundle of joy. Choosing your baby’s name should be fun! Are you a traditionalist? Maybe you’ve always wanted to name your baby after your favorite Aunt Charlotte. Well, guess what? Charlotte happens to be #8 on this year’s top 10 Baby Names list!</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">Are you thinking about something a bit more unique, like Jaxon or Layla? Although those two names are not as common as John or Mary, they are still within the top 40 baby names for 2013! Do you like the name Pailslee? It’s the 560<sup>th</sup> most popular name, so if you want to name your baby something that you don’t hear every day, that may work! How about Calliope or “Twin?” Yes, TWIN!</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">The internet is full of great ideas for naming your baby, (and so are your friends and family, for that matter!) What’s most important is that you and your partner agree on a name together. Remember, this is<i> your</i> baby. Grandma or Grandpa may not agree with the name you choose, but give it time- they’ll get used to the name you choose after time! If you’d like to see what’s on the top 10 list of names for 2013, check out these names from BabyCenter.com:</p>

<p class="has-background has-drop-cap has-very-light-gray-background-color">Although the exact origin of April Fool’s Day is unknown, we always love to celebrate, don’t we? April Fools&#8217; Day is observed throughout the Western world. &nbsp;Some of the practices include sending someone on a &#8220;fool&#8217;s errand,&#8221; looking for things that don&#8217;t exist; playing pranks; and trying to get people to believe ridiculous things.</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">With the overwhelmingly popular television shows like: “Candid Camera,” “Who’s Line is it Anyway?” “Punk’d,” and Canada’s “Just for Laughs Gags,” it’s clear that we love to laugh.</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">The French call April 1 <i>Poisson d&#8217;Avril</i>, or &#8220;April Fish.&#8221; French children sometimes tape a picture of a fish on the back of their schoolmates, crying &#8220;Poisson d&#8217;Avril&#8221; when the prank is discovered.</p>

<p class="has-background has-drop-cap has-very-light-gray-background-color">We have heard from a lot of expectant mothers who have shared their horror stories about having their tummies publicly (or privately) touched by strangers. Some moms are not bothered if a family member or friend does the touching, but it’s a different story when a perfect stranger asks, “Can I touch your belly?”</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">During this time, you may be experiencing a great deal of emotional stress throughout your pregnancy, whether it’s due to relationships, moving to a bigger home to make room for baby, finances, etc. We have found that typically, the “crime” occurs when you’re out shopping, at a park, at work, or the like. When a stranger asks to touch, or even rub your belly, your first reaction may be to say, “Don’t touch my tummy!” Keep in mind that this is a very natural response. One thing we would recommend would be to simply ask them to please not touch you. Additionally, you can tell people that you are not comfortable being touched by strangers. Another thing you could do is to put your hand in front of your belly if you see them reaching toward you. Be warned, however, we’ve heard that some of the eager belly rubbers can be pretty quick on the draw!</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color">Although you may be tempted to react out of frustration, or even retaliate by giving them a dose of their own medicine, (rubbing <i>their</i> belly) we have found that by just giving them a smile and a gentle hand motion to shield your belly, most folks will take the hint. This will also avoid any potential hostility on their part. If you keep in mind that some people see your belly and react with excitement at the prospect of new life, they may be acting on impulse, later regretting their behavior! Your gracious, but clear response may cause them to think twice before attempting to invade your&#8212;or anyone else’s space.</p>

<p class="has-background has-drop-cap has-very-light-gray-background-color">According to &#8220;Life Before Birth,&#8221; the website for the Association for Prenatal and Perinatal Psychology and Health, your baby can hear your voice as early as the 16th week of pregnancy! Of course, since you’re carrying your baby for 9 months, he/she will recognize you right away when you “meet” for the first time. Isn’t it good to know that Daddy can also carry on a conversation with baby, too? We meet many fathers who speak right into Mommy’s belly throughout her pregnancy. Feel free to do the same! Your baby will respond to you more than you think. Oh, and don’t forget, your baby can also hear music. So turn up the Mozart, Manilow, or M.J. while you wait for your baby to arrive!</p>

<p class="has-background has-drop-cap has-very-light-gray-background-color"><b></b>Your baby is working very hard in his/her first few weeks of life while in your tummy! Trying to get comfy in their new living quarters is no easy feat! Sometimes, they have their head up (in the Breech position) but don’t worry! Babies like to shift around frequently! If your baby is in the Breech position when we are doing your ultrasound, we have a couple of exercises that we ask you to do several times &nbsp;a day until you begin to feel some shifting and stretching:</p>



<p>Exercise #1.</p>



<ol><li>Get on your hands and knees.</li><li>Sway your hips side to side, left to right</li></ol>



<p>Exercise #2.</p>



<ol><li>Lay flat on your back.</li><li>Place 2-4 pillows under your bottom so that it’s higher than your head. Babies don’t like that!</li><li>Lay in that position for no longer than 5-10 minutes.</li></ol>



<p>If you feel light-headed or have a difficult time catching your breath from the weight of the baby, roll over and get up after you’re feeling better.</p>



<p>If you feel an uncomfortable, unusual movement or stretch from your baby, then it means that he/she is moving head down. Once you feel this, you don’t need to do the exercise anymore!</p>
